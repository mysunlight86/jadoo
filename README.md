Travel Agency Landing Page ([a layout](https://www.figma.com/file/UUfZFgIwD53h4T2AAUO43C/Jadoo?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=he6CQazn7wkerrB4-0))

I chose this layout for layout practice. I liked this theme for its variety of elements and simply because I like to travel.

## What did I do?

- I laid out the entire page according to the layout: added HTML markup and CSS styles.

- Added effects when hovering and clicking on some elements.

- Stylized the form elements.

- Added decorative images in the background.

- Used semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<p>`, `<h1> - <h6>`, `<ul>` and others.

- Used pseudo-elements, flexbox and grid to create a flexible layout.

## Functionality

The layout is designed for travel agencies and people, who offer travel services.
